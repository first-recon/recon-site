    <div>
        <div>Recon is a scouting app and analytics platform for FIRST Tech Challenge. I originally created the app to help my team scout more effectively, but as I was building it, I realized the data being collected by teams could be collected and used to make a lot of interesting things possible - small teams without the ability to scout effectively could benefit from team-level match scores (something that is currently not shared).</div>
        <div>This data can also be used to start more informed conversations about FTC game designs themselves. Often, the community will chat about various elements of a game being too easy, difficult for rookie teams, or just pointless overall relative to other objectives. With Recon, we can gather concrete data that can guide our strategy and discussions moving forward.</div>
